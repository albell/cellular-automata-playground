# One-Dimensional Cellular Automata Playground

This repo contains the source code for the working site [here](https://albell.github.io/cellular-automata-playground).

### Building the Project
To install dependencies, run `npm install` at the command line in the root of the project.
To compile the CSS and JavaScript, run `grunt`.

To make changes to a local copy of the project, just edit the unminified CSS and Javascript source files.

Source and compiled files are both committed in the repo because Github pages needs them for hosting (and besides it makes for nice source maps).

Feedback is welcome. Please just file an issue. I ask that you please get in touch first before filing any pull requests.
